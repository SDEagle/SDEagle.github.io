Gungor recently [released](http://www.gungormusic.com/blog/2015/8/one-wild-life-soul) a new album called ["One Wild Life - Soul"](https://open.spotify.com/album/10AcM3kGWjAlPITEcUsN7W).
It's the first in a trilogy of albums - the second one will come out around November and the third in 2016.
Now when Gungor announced this I was absolutely thrilled.
During the past years Gungor has probably become my favourite band in christian music.
Maybe set aside gospel.
Or maybe not.
A friend of mine introduced me to them a while ago, and after some initial not quite getting it I absolutely fell in love with their music, especially with the third album ["I Am Mountain"](https://open.spotify.com/album/1yoTAwQTkC158aviXY4CZ1).
Which is not to say, that the [other](https://open.spotify.com/album/2fezbaVpWGGtsIvs8vHZLA) [two](https://open.spotify.com/album/6yMLnZevb16KCYplXiyeAY) wouldn't be amazing (containing e.g. absolutely incredible songs like ["Dry Bones"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4ywugrAa8pJtzVOFWaLnWz) and ["You are the Beauty"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4EKs4KYHtKRkyYuuNcIe6o)).
Sometimes I even miss songs of that certain style in the third album but as a whole/concept it still works best in my opinion.
Manages to drag me in every time.
I'm listening to it a lot.

So when they announced another album to come I was going a little crazy.
I had listened quite a bit to the [Liturgists podcast](http://www.theliturgists.com/podcast/), so I had some ideas what to expect.
Certainly no happy-clappy-superchristian-what-in-the-world-is-doubt-worship.
And they mentioned it might be their best work so far.
Sounded like the cocktail for some amazing music to me.
So I had some high expectations.
Did it meet them?

Well...

Sort of...

The first thing I heard from the new record was ["Us for them"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCZjWd_iecU) ([GEMA-land link](https://www.facebook.com/gungormusic/videos/10156067943790162/)) (Actually it was not, there was "Vapor" before, but that was released in the Liturgists context, so I did not experience it there as a part of this album at this point).
That one certainly met the expectations.
If I remember correctly when hearing it for the very first time I was like 'eeeem... Pop?' but on the second time that felt just right.
And then the lyrics. One lined goes 'Now our enemies are blessed'.
Wow.
Absolute goosebump moment.
That to me gets more of christianity right then a lot of those Hillsong worship songs together.
In some parts the text sounds a little too relativistic to my taste ("We reject the either or" - well to some things there actually is a definite answer) but if you take Gungors situation into account (getting a chrstian shitstorm for basically saying that they can't believe in literal seven day creation some sixthousand years ago anymore - I mean WTF? A christian shitstorm? How can such a thing even exist?) and that the song is more about actual people ("Us" and "Them") instead of theologic concepts I can live with that.

So promising enough.
I bought the season pass for the whole thing and got into it.
It starts of with "Intro" - something like a little modernised tuning orchestra.
Great atmosphere, expectations still rising.
It fluently makes the transition into the second song ["Lion of Rock"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOm5V_p_wHk) ([poor germans](https://www.facebook.com/gungormusic/videos/10155923258125162/)).
And "Oh my..." this song is absolutely killing it.
On [the Liturgists](http://www.theliturgists.com/manifesto/) page they state they value beauty.
And this song is just the sound-turned-proove for that.
Absolutely mind blowing.
Starting almost arrhythmic, building up into some RnBish slow groove, all with amazing (and nerdy) sound design, incredible dynamics, carried out by the whole band as if it was one single instrument, building up more and more until it explodes into an anthem on the beauty god created.
Wow.
Like so good, that it immediately drags you out of that observing meta position into just enjoying the great music.
Why think about expectations when you can listen to such awesome music.

It continues as strong.
"Moon Song" - great groove, great soundscape, nice harmonies and exactly the right way of a little relaxing to catch a breath after this explosion of beauty before.
Love it.

Next is the title track "One wild life".
And that was when to my great surprise the album completely lost me.
In the beginning I thought it may be just this track.
Because it’s kinda 80s.
Still well made music.
Just not really my taste.
But as it turns out it's not really the song but something about the whole album.

"One Wild Life: Soul" starts with a beautiful flow, bringing up memories of "I am Mountain".
But after the third track it suddenly makes a huge leap in mood - and it suddenly falls into peaces - pretty literally.
The songs that follow are all really good music.
Most are actually great.
But they just don’t make a real whole together to my perception.
Each one works well independently - and according to Gungors blog many were indeed written on completely different occasions.

There is [“Light”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_uioQqW8ac) ([sigh](https://www.facebook.com/gungormusic/videos/10155786325700162/)) which was written for/about their newborn daughter with Down Syndrom - super strong song.
There is “At Sea” which is basically Lisas part of the story of Michaels faith crisis and another really great song.
There is “Us for Them” about which I talked above.
Then there are “Am I” and “You” again from Michaels point of view on his faith crisis.
“You” is great.
It features such a wonderful dirty guitar solo, I was instantly reminded of ["So Sehr Dabei" from Clueso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UePVrFq7Shk).
“Am I” is maybe the only song on the entire album where I could give concret musical reasons why I think it’s not that great (but still good).
Which would be: “Am I” tries too hard to sound dark and confused.
Make it arrhythmic that always sounds crazy.
And then because everything is sooo messed up and disoriented lets pick a major scale but diminish the 6th and hit it as often as we can.
And as [Vihart](https://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart) pointed out in her brilliant video [Twelve Tones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4niz8TfY794) when you try to communicate something too hard you fall into the cliche trap and [everything that is actually communicated is the intent to communicate](https://youtu.be/4niz8TfY794?t=18m28s).
Last but not least there is [“Vapor”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3-dKm1W7qQ) ([really, germany](https://www.facebook.com/gungormusic/videos/10155872769835162/)) which also was actually composed for another occasion, for the [Liturgists Vapor meditation](http://www.theliturgists.com/vapor/). Also a great song, makes a really nice finish-up.

So lots of great songs here.
Released independently I would love most of them.
Sadly, I think thrown together they just don’t make that much of an amazing album.
Makes a weird conclusion. Album … yeah okish, but the songs are really amazing.
But thats what I think here.
You should definitely listen to it, anyways.
Buy it, actually.

In any case I’m very much looking forward to the next one.
There is no reason to be afraid that Gungor would have suddenly stopped making great music.
Actually quite the contrary.
