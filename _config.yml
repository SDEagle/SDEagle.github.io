  This is the blog of Tim who was once asked to describe himself in three words. 
  He said: “nerd, musician, christian”. That sums it up pretty much. 
  Currently he is doing a six month internship in Stockholm before finishing his masters degree in 
  computer science at the Karlsruhe Institute for Technology (Germany).
